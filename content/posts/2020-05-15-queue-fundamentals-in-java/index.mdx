### Queue

#### What is Queue?

Queue is one of the many data structures in programming.
One of the best example of queue is people standing in a row to get the movie tickets or train tickets. The person who comes first, will get the ticket first. For the same reason queue is also called **First In First Out (FIFO)** data structure.

#### Important functions in Queue

If we talk about very simple queue, then there are very limited functions a queue has.

**enqueue():** This pushes the element at the end of the queue.

**dequeue():** This removes and returns the element from the beginning of the queue.

**size():** This returns the current size of the queue.

#### Queue Implementation

Queue can be implemented using array or linkedlist.
We will use linkedlist to implement queue for below reasons:

1. No limit on queue capacity
2. Shifting elements is costly in array, we can avoid that when we dequeue elements

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class Queue {
    int size;
    Node front;
    Node rear;

    public Queue() {
        size = 0;
        front = null;
        rear = null;
    }

    public void enqueue(int data) {
        Node node = new Node(data);
        if(front == null) {
            front = node;
            rear = node;
            size = size+1;
        }
        rear.next = node;
        rear = rear.next;
        rear.next = null;
        size = size+1;
    }

    public int dequeue() {
        int data = front.data;
        front = front.next;
        size = size-1;
        return data;
    }
    public int size() {
        return size;
    }

    public void printQueue() {
        Node temp = front;
        while(temp != null) {
            System.out.print(temp.data+" ");
            temp = temp.next;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue queue = new Queue();
        queue.enqueue(10);
        queue.enqueue(20);
        queue.enqueue(30);
        queue.printQueue();
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("de-queued = "+queue.dequeue());
        queue.printQueue();
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Current queue size="+ queue.size());
    }
}
```

#### Console output

```console
10 20 30 
de-queued = 10
20 30 
Current queue size=3
```
