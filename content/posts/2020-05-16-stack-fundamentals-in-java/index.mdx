#### What is a Stack?

Stack is one of the many data structures in programming.
One of the best example of stack is books kept on top of each other on a table. The book kept on the top is picked first. For the same reason stack is also called **Last In First Out (LIFO)** data structure.

#### Important functions in Stack

If we talk about very simple stack, then there are very limited functions a stack has.

**push():** This pushes the element at the top of the stack.

**pop():** This removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.

**size():** This returns the current size of the stack.

**peek()** This just returns the top value without removing it from the stack.

#### Stack Implementation

Stack can be implemented using array or linkedlist.
We will be using LinkedList for the demonstration.

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class Stack {
    Node top;
    int size;
    public Stack() {
        top = null;
        size = 0;
    }

    public void push(int data) {
        Node node = new Node(data);
        if(top == null) {
            top = node;
        } else {
            Node temp = top;
            top = node;
            node.next = temp;
        }
        size = size+1;
    }

    public int pop() {
        int val = top.data;
        top = top.next;
        size = size-1;
        return val;
    }

    public int peek() {
        return top.data;
    }

    public void printStack() {
        Node temp = top;
        while(temp != null) {
            System.out.println(temp.data);
            temp = temp.next;
        }
    }

    public int size() {
        return size;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack stack = new Stack();
        stack.push(10);
        stack.push(20);
        stack.push(30);
        System.out.println("Current stack printed below with size:"+stack.size());
        stack.printStack();
        System.out.println("Popped value:"+ stack.pop());
        System.out.println("Current stack printed below with size:"+stack.size());
        stack.printStack();
        System.out.println("Peek the top value:"+stack.peek());
    }
}
```

#### Console output

```console
Current stack printed below with size:3
30
20
10
Popped value:30
Current stack printed below with size:2
20
10
Peek the top value:20
```
