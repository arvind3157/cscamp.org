By profession, I am a software engineer. I write code on my computer so that the computer can perform a certain task. Other than that I’m an avid runner. I don’t claim to be expert in either of it, but I enjoy being beginner and learner. I’m here to share my experience in software development and running. Why I chose to do so? I believe when you write down something in words you are more disciplined about it. Most of the time I might just document my learning so that other people can learn from my mistake.
