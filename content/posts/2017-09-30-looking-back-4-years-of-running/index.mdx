This picture was taken during the 2nd marathon in the year 2014 at Hyderabad. Total 4 years of running and I’m still a beginner. I still lose my sleep before race day. I still get the same excitement and amount of adrenaline rush at the start line. I still suck after 32kms and crawl till the finish line. I still get side stitches when running a full marathon. But, nothing is going to stop me from being a better runner. I will continue to evolve as a runner, as a person. One day I will cross 32 km with a smiling face and humbly I will say, ’32 km’, fuck you. I’m stronger. I don’t suck anymore. I’m going to kill the remaining 10 km with the same smiling face. I’m sure even after loosing, you will be proud of me. Because that’s what you wanted, a better version of me perhaps. Our talks will continue, so my running.
