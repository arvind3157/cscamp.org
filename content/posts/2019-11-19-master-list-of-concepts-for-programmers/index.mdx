Computer Science as a domain is huge, I just tried to make a list to make it easy for someone starting in this field. This list is not particular to any specialization, anybody with tag #software_engineer, #software_developer, #programmer must learn these concepts to justify those tags. Even I’m learning some of these things.

1. Learn any one programming language really well. I mean really well. Preferably that supports object oriented programming
    * C++
    * Java
    * Python
    * Javascript
    * Ruby

2. Version control system
    * Git

3. Source code control system
    * Github
    * Bitbucket

4. Master command line
    * Unix/Linux
    * Mac

5. Operating System Concepts
    * Process and Process Management
    * Threads and Concurrency
    * Scheduling
    * Memory Management
    * Inter-Process Communication
    * Input/OutPut Management
    * Virtualization
    * Distributed File System
    * Distributed Shared Memory
    * Cloud Computing

6. Networking
    * Internet Protocols – tcp/ip, http/https, udp, ftp, smtp etc
    * Layered architecture – osi model, tcp/ip model
    * IP address – ipv4, ipv6, subnets

7. Database Management System
    * Learn RDBMS concepts
    * Master anyone database
        * Oracle, MySql, Postgresql

8. OOPs concepts
    * Polymorphism
    * Inheritance
    * Abstraction
    * Encapsulation

9. Data Structures
    * Arrays
    * Queues
    * Stacks
    * Linked Lists
    * Map
    * Set
    * Trees – (Specially BST)
    * Graph

10. Algorithms
    * Sorting
        * Merge Sort
        * Quick Sort
        * Bucket Sort
        * Heap Sort
    * Recursive – not an algorithm, rather concepts or mindset
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Depth First Search
    * Breadth First Search
    * Tree Traversals – In Order, Pre Order, Post Order

11. Important Design Patterns
    * Creational Design Pattern
        * Singleton
        * Builder
        * Factory
        * Abstract Factory
        * Prototype
    * Behavioral Design Pattern
        * Strategy
        * Observer
        * Mediator
        * Visitor
    * Structural Design Pattern
        * Adapter
        * Decorator

12. Software Design Principles
    * Single Responsibility Principle
    * Open/Closed Principle
    * Liskov Substitution Principle
    * Interface Segregation Principle
    * Dependency Inversion Principle

13. System Design Considerations
    * Security
    * Scalability
    * Load balancing
    * Caching

14. Learn a tool to build something concrete – how about a web development framework?
    * Node.js
    * Ruby on Rails
    * Django
    * Python
    * Spring boot

15. General
    * Multithreading
    * Containerisation – docker, kubernetes
    * Learn how CI/CD pipeline works
    * Learn one cloud platform – heroku, aws, azure etc

I will keep updating the list. Let me know in the comment box if you think I missed something really important.
